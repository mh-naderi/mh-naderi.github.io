**Hi**! This is Mohammadhossein (MH), a soon-to-graduate MSc student in Computer Science at [York University](https://yorku.ca) in Toronto, where I was supervised by Professor [Hamzeh Khazaei](https://hamzehkhazaei.github.io/) at the [Performant and Available Computing Systems (PACS) Lab](https://pacs.eecs.yorku.ca/), working on efficient distributed training methods for large-scale machine learning. My research lies at the intersection of systems and machine learning, where I apply systems techniques to improve the efficiency, scalability, and adaptability of ML workloads. Before coming to York, I earned my BSc in Computer Engineering from [Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)](https://aut.ac.ir/en) under the supervision of Professor [Hamid Reza Zarandi](https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2188/Hamid%20Reza%20Zarandi).
