**Hi**! This is Mohammadhossein (MH), a soon-to-graduate MSc student in Computer Science at [York University](https://lassonde.yorku.ca/eecs/) in Toronto, where I was supervised by Professor [Hamzeh Khazaei](https://hamzehkhazaei.github.io/) at the [Performant and Available Computing Systems (PACS) Lab](https://pacs.eecs.yorku.ca/), working on efficient distributed training methods for large-scale machine learning. I’m particularly interested in adapting model partitioning to heterogeneous cloud environments to reduce training time and improve scalability. Before coming to York, I earned my BSc in Computer Engineering from [Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)](https://aut.ac.ir/en).
